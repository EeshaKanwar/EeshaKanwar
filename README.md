- 👋 "Hello World;" I’m @EeshaKanwar
- 👀 I’m an emerging programmer, UX/UI designer, and accountant!
- 🌱 I’m currently an undergraduate student at Wilfrid Laurier University enrolled in BBA + CS dual degree program.
- 💻 So far, I have mainly done programming inside a classroom for projects and assignments. 
- 📈 But, I do have experience working as a bookkeeper and can handle basic journal entries and bank reconciliations on Quickbooks.
- 💞️ Consider me "a jack of all, master of none, but oftentimes better than a master of one."
